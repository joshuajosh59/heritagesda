Hundreds of thousands of Christians became convinced from their study of Bible prophecy that Christ would soon return. This re-awakening of a neglected Biblical belief occurred in many countries, with a major focus in North America.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">After the “great disappointment” of their hopes in 1844, these advent believers broke up into a number of different groups. One group, studying their Bibles for increased understanding, recognized the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) as the day of worship. This group, which included Ellen and James White and Joseph Bates, became the nucleus of the church congregations that chose the name “Seventh-day Adventist Church” and organized in Battle Creek, Michigan, with 125 churches and 3,500 members.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Ellen White‘s ministry under God’s special guidance greatly influenced the development of the Adventist Church. Her counsels and messages to believers and church leaders shaped the form and progress of the church, while its beliefs have remained totally Bible-based.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Other early Adventists of note include John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the “cornflake” along with his brother Will, and pioneer of the Battle Creek Sanitarium; Joseph Bates, retired sea captain and first leader of an Adventist administration; Uriah Smith, prolific author and inventor, and editor of the church’s paper for almost 50 years.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Adventist missionaries began work outside of North America in 1864, and ten years later J. N. Andrews was sent to Switzerland as the denomination’s first official missionary. In 1890, an Adventist minister began working in Russia, while in 1894 church operations commenced in Africa (Ghana and South Africa). Missionaries also arrived in South America in 1894, and in Japan in 1896. The church now operates in 209 countries and territories worldwide.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">Growth from the early days has been dramatic. From the small group meeting in 1846 and the organization of the church with 3,500 believers, Seventh-day Adventists now number 18.7 million worldwide.</p></div><div id="c1524" class="Block"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n5"><h2><a href="http://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/">Beliefs</a></h2></div><p class="bodytext"><a id="beliefs"></a></p><ol><li><strong><a href="http://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/god/holy-scriptures/">Bible / Holy Scriptures</a></strong> -&nbsp;Ancient and timeless, a masterpiece of literature, the Holy Bible reveals God’s role in human history, our place in God’s plan, and truth to guide us and shield us from deception.</li> <li><strong><a href="http://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/salvation/the-life-death-and-resurrection-of-christ/">The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ</a></strong> -&nbsp;God sent Jesus, His Son, to live the perfect life we could not and die the death our sins deserve.

Begun in 1958, these studies have covered topics such as diet, air pollution, religion, and health, and have gained the sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the World Cancer Research Fund. </li> <li>In addition to being one of the largest and most comprehensive studies on diet and longevity, the Adventist Health Study-2, which surveyed the lifestyle of 96,000 Adventists, is also one of the largest dietary studies of African-Americans and sheds light on why this group has more cases of cancer and heart disease than other ethnic groups in America. </li></ul><h3><a href="http://education.gc.adventist.org/" target="_blank">Education</a></h3><ul><li> The Adventist Church has the world’s second largest integrated network of schools, with more than 7,500 schools worldwide enrolling more than 1.8 million students. </li> <li>Since the 1850s, when the first Adventist school was formed, Adventists have believed that education should be redemptive in nature, with the purpose of restoring human beings to the image of God, our Creator. Adventist education also includes a focus on mental, physical, social, and spiritual health; as well as intellectual growth and service to humanity. <p>&nbsp;</p> </li></ul><h3><a href="http://healthministries.com/" target="_blank">Health Outreach </a></h3><ul><li>The Adventist Church focuses on a “ministry of healing,” which encompasses catering to the spiritual, physical, mental, and social needs of people around the world. </li> <li>The church held the Global Conference on Health and Lifestyle at the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. More than 750 people from 95 countries learned more information about providing improved health and spiritual care for the global community. </li> <li>Seventh-day Adventists established a master’s degree program throughout the continent of Africa that equips pastors with comprehensive health courses. The pastors learn not only the anatomy of health, but also practical applications of the Adventist lifestyle. </li> <li>The church developed the “Breathe-Free” program, a smoking cessation program that has helped hundreds of thousands of people worldwide quit smoking. It is the official smoking cessation program of China and Taiwan. </li></ul><h3><a href="http://family.adventist.org" target="_blank">Family Outreach</a></h3><ul><li> The Adventist Church helps nurture marriages and families because strong marriages lead to strong families, and strong families lead to strong churches, strong communities, and strong nations. </li> <li>The church has programs and ministries to help enhance communication, problem-solving, and relationship skills. </li></ul><h3><a href="http://gcyouthministries.org/" target="_blank">Youth Outreach</a></h3><ul><li> The Adventist Church provides resources to lead young people into a saving relationship with Jesus and help them embrace His call to discipleship. </li> <li> Outreach programs include the Adventurer Club (for ages 6-9) and the Pathfinder Club (for ages 10-15). These programs offer specialized weekly activities to promote psychological and spiritual development through camping, marching, community projects, vocational training, and arts and crafts. </li> <li> Youth Outreach also provides an opportunity for more than 100 young adults from all over the world to volunteer in a major city every year for what is known as “One Year in Mission.”</li></ul></div><div id="c1529" class="Block"><div class="csc-header csc-header-n8"><h2>Humanitarian / Community Service</h2></div><p class="bodytext"><a id="service"></a>
